    "description": "Akishika Shuzō – Sake from Farm to Bottle\nFounded in 1886, Akishika Shuzō is located in Nose Town, the northernmost part of Osaka Prefecture. Since its inception, the brewery has been deeply rooted in rice cultivation. While it originally used local table rice, Akishika began cultivating the esteemed Yamada Nishiki sake rice in 1985, expanding its rice paddies from 3 hectares to 25 hectares today.\nA Philosophy of “Nōjō Ikkan” – Farm-Brewed Unity\nAkishika practices a “farm-to-bottle” philosophy, producing sake entirely from rice they cultivate themselves or source from dedicated contract farmers. Nearly 40% of their rice comes from organic, chemical-free paddies managed by the brewery&apos; s young team, using sustainable compost made from rice husks, bran, and sake lees.\nSince 2003, 100% of their sake has been junmai (pure rice sake), with a focus on low polishing rates to preserve the full flavor of the rice. They employ traditional yeasts and strive to minimize sake lees, extracting close to 100% of the rice&apos;s umami. Their sake is known for its rich depth and vibrant acidity, offering complexity without heaviness.\nAkishika Shuzō is more than a brewery—it &aposs a sake château, cultivating terroir and tradition in every bottle."
