Its mild, savory flavor brings warmth to the soul with every sip.Toppings include tender slices of chashu pork, aromatic green onions, house-made chicken meatballs (tsukune), and sweet onions that enhance the broth's natural richness.Each element pairs harmoniously with the soup, offering a satisfying and balanced experience in every bite.Finished with thin noodles that gently soak up the white miso flavor, this bowl is loved by everyone—from seasoned ramen fans to children tasting miso ramen for the first time.",
